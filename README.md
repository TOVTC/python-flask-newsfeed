  # Just Tech News
  This SQLAlchemy and Flask Python application is a refactor of an existing full-stack JavaScript web application. Just like the original, this application allows users to make, comment upon, and vote on community-generated posts. This application uses a model-view-controller framework to handle data. Users are able to create and login to personal accounts, create, edit, and delete posts + upvote and comment on posts. The application on the front end uses Jinja for its templating engine. On the backend, Flask replaces Node.js and Express.js, and SQLAlchemy replaces Sequelize.
